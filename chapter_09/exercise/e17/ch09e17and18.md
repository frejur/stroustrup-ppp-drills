- Exercises 17 and 18
Give an example of where an object of type 'Rational' would provide a mathematically more accurate result than an object of type:
    1. 'Money'
    2. double

A Rational would give a better result whenever fractions with repeating decimals are involved, such as 1/3 = 0.333333333333... Or really any fractional number with a lot of significant digits.

Example:
- Splitting a tab of $4000 among 28 people. The Rational '1000/7' is more precise than the decimal value (142.857142857...) represented as either a Money object or a double.

Money and double both represent numbers as decimal numbers, only Money is more suited for financial data. This is due to the inherent limitations of the floating-point types.

Example:
- '$1.1 * 100'. Without rounding this yields '110.00000000000001' when using a double.
    An object of type Money would instead treat this as '110 cents * 100', use integer arithmetic and yield the correct result of '11000 cents = $110'.
    An object of type Rational would yield '11/10 * 100 = 110/1'.
