## Chapter 2 - Review

##### What is the purpose of a "Hello World" program?
To demonstrate the basic syntax and functionality of a given programming language, both to provide a quick insight to the characteristics of the language and to compare it to other languages.

##### Name the four parts of a function
1. A __return type__
2. A __name__
3. A __parameter list__
4. A __function body__

##### Name a function that must appear in every C++ program
int main() {}

##### In the "Hello World" program, what is the purpose of the line ___return 0___
To simultaneously exit the program and signal that it completed successfully, any non-zero value would signal some form of exception or error. This return value can be used by the operating system or other software.

##### What is the purpose of the compiler
To translate a high level language such as C++ into machine code

##### What's the purpose of the #include directive?
To insert the declarations of external code libraries into the current namespace

##### What does the __.h__ file extension signify in C++?
A header file containing the declaration of functions and objects of C++ source files.

##### What does the linker do for your program
It links the compiled C++ objects together that they may operate in unison and form an executable.

##### What's the difference between a source file and an object file?
Source files contain the instructions needed for the compiler to generate machine code for the object files which are consequently used to build and run the end product.

##### What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
An Integrated Development Environment streamlines and simplifies software development by providing features such as syntax highlighting, version control, debugging, and automated builds.

#### Why is practise necessary?
Reading about programming concepts and best practises is always useful, but coding itself is best learned by doing.
