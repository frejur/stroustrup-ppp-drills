     The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.

     It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
          With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

     "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
          If you never were met with again--
     But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
          You might have suggested it then?

          As I think I've already remarked."

          "I informed you the day we embarked.

     "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--
          (We are all of us weak at times):
     But the slightest approach to a false pretence
          Was never among my crimes!

"It is bidden to every man," says Kari, "to seek to save his life while
he has a choice, and I will do so now; but still this parting of ours
will be in such wise that we shall never see one another more; for if I
leap out of the fire, I shall have no mind to leap back into the fire to
thee, and then each of us will have to fare his own way."

"It joys me, brother-in-law," says Skarphedinn, "to think that if thou
gettest away thou wilt avenge me."

Then Kari took up a blazing bench in his hand, and runs up along the
cross-beam, then he hurls the bench out at the roof, and it fell among
those who were outside.

Then they ran away, and by that time all Kari's upper-clothing and his
hair were ablaze, then he threw himself down from the roof, and so crept
along with the smoke.
