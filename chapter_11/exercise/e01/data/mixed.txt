Capital I

We all live in a capital I.
In the middle of the desert.
In the center of the sky.

All day long we polish up the I.
To make it clean and shiny.
So it brightens up the sky.
Rubbing it here.
And scrubbing it there.
Polishing the I.
So high in the air.

And as we work we sing a lively tune.
"It is great to be so happy on a busy afternoon."
And when we're through with the day's only chore.
We go into the I.
And we close the door.

Capital I, capital I, capital I, capital I.
